# LipSync_Wav2lip

## Overview

This project utilizes the simplified version of Wav2Lip to synchronize audio with lip movement in videos. Below are the Colab links for running the code and accessing the outputs:

### Implementation with Wav2Lip_Simplified

### Alternative Input for Demonstration

Due to some frames in the initial input video lacking faces, an alternative video was used to demonstrate Wav2Lip-Coderformers.

## How to Use

1. Open the provided Colab links.
2. Upload your input videos and audios to the Colab environment.
3. Follow the instructions and run the code cells in the Colab notebook.
4. Retrieve the output videos generated during the process.

Feel free to experiment with different input videos to observe the lip-syncing capabilities of Wav2Lip.
